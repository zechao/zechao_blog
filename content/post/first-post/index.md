# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, and I want to share a bit about how I built this blog and what you can expect from it in the future.

## How I Built This Blog

I built this blog using **Hugo**, a fast and flexible static site generator. For the design, I chose [**hugo-theme-stack**](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) as the main theme, and for my about page, I used [**almeida-cv**](https://github.com/ineesalmeida/almeida-cv), which also includes my resume.

Here is the result of my [About](http://devzechao.com/about/)

The site is deployed using **GitHub Pages**, with **GitHub Actions** handling the automation for building and deploying the blog. All the images used in my blog are stored in **Cloudflare R2**, ensuring fast and reliable delivery.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

I plan to write a detailed post on how I set up this blog, including:

-   Setting up Hugo with multiple themes.
-   Configuring GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions for deployment
-   Storing and serving images with Cloudflare R2

Stay tuned for more updates! If you're interested in building a blog like this, keep an eye out for my upcoming post.
